/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/GDL/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.py:149: UserWarning: The epoch parameter in `scheduler.step()` was not necessary and is being deprecated where possible. Please use `scheduler.step()` to step the scheduler. During the deprecation, if epoch is different from None, the closed form is used instead of the new chainable form, where available.
